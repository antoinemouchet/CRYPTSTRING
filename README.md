# 2021_INFOB318_CRYPTSTRING

This repository contains the whole work for my individual project of BAC3 at UNamur. I was supervised by Jean-Noel Colin, teacher at UNamur and member of the InfoSec research team.

## Code

The code can be found in the "code" directory.

A README there will explain you how to launch the app.

## Testing

I used [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) to test my code. To see the tests and their results, go to the "jasmine" directory and open "specRunner.html" in your web browser.
